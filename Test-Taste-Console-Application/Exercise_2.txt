Exercise 2 Answer

1.The existing solution is a synchronous approach(Except httprequests).
We can make it asynchronous as each requests are independent loading specific data.
2.Instead of calculating a Average moon gravity in property,
We can implement a caching mechanisim to retreive the same value until the moons property gets affected.

Drawbacks of Existing Solution.
It requires lot of time to execute completely because of its synchronous nature.
It needs to to calculate Average moon gravity whenever the get property is accessed.

Benifits of Alternative solution.

It is comparitively faster than existing solution.
It reduces computation.
